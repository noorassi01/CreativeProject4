      <h5> My name is Noor Assi, I am from Palestine and I am a sophomore at BYU. I made this website for people to share their favorite quotes from books and movies. A lot of people struggle to put their thoughts into words and I believe that the quotes we like reflect our feelings. So, please share you favorite quote and please do not delete or edit others quotes :))</h5>
